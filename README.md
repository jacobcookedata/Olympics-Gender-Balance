# Gender Equality at the Olympic Games

This project was my final submission for the Coursera Specialisation: Learn SQL Basics for Data Science. 

This project demonstrates the following skills:
 - SQLite queries in a Python environment using the Pandasql package
 - Developed complex subqueries to define new metrics measuring gender equality in Olympics Games and their sports
 - Data wrangling with Pandas
 - Visualisations using the Python packages Matplotlib, Seaborn and Bokeh

I have demonstrated a clear, but decreasing, deficit in female participation in every Olympic Games in history. There are many sports which are equal in both participation and medal opportunities for men and women. However, some events are male-only, or have many fewer events available for women. This clearly highlights that providing more medal events for women, and increasing the number of women competing for those medals, would lead to a more equal Olympics.
